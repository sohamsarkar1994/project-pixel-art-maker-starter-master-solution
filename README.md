## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Working

Primarily, the user has to choose a color from the color-palette.

Secondly, the user has to choose the 'width' and the 'height' to design the desired design canvas.

Values should be between 1 to 50.

Clicking on submit button creates a grid of desired size.

Now the user can design the canvas by clicking on its cells with the desired color.

The user can change the colors by choosing from the colorpicker again.

Submitting again will refresh the grid.
